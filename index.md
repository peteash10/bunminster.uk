### [Bunminster, Joy and Clem](http://bunminster.uk/the_buns/) are rabbits living in a garden in Birmingham, UK.

This website is run by their owners/servants [Fiona](http://fionacullinan.com) and [Pete](http://peteashton.com) who have been caring for rabbits since 2013. It will eventually contain everything they've learned about rabbits, shared for the benefit of others. We hope you find it useful!

## Bunstagram

We're very active in the bunny corner of [Instagram](http://instagram.com/bunminster/) where we're friends with lots of other rabbit owners. Beyond the cute, it's a great community of mutual help and support whenever something goes wrong. 

[**Come join us!**](http://instagram.com/bunminster/) 

Pics from Instagram are automatically posted to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bunminster/) and [Tumblr](https://bunminster.tumblr.com), though we don't monitor those accounts very much. 

## Rabbit resources

We plan to build this section up over the year. So far we have: 

[Rabbit Essentials](http://bunminster.uk/essentials/) - a very basic guide to keeping rabbits.

[Rabbit Food](http://bunminster.uk/rabbit_food/) - what we feed our little dudes. ![](images/new2.gif)  

[Rabbit's Guide to Birmingham](http://bunminster.uk/birmingham/) - the vets and suppliers we recommend in our home town. 

## Support our friends

## Weights

We monitor the weight of our rabbits to check there are no problems. Since we have the data, here's a chart!

## Their Home

We'll be writing a page on housing outdoor rabbits soon, but for now here's a video guide to our current setup.
