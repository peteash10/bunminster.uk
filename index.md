# Bunminster and Friends

**Bunminster, Joy and Clem are rabbits living in a garden in Birmingham, UK.**

This website is run by their owners/servants Fiona and Pete. It will eventually contain everything they've learned about rabbits, shared for the benefit of others. We hope you find it useful!

## Bunstagram

We're most active in the rabbit sector of [Instagram](http://instagram.com/bunminster/) where we're friends with lots of other rabbit owners. Beyond the cute, it's a great community of mutual help and support whenever something goes wrong. 

[**Come join us!**](http://instagram.com/bunminster/) 

Pics from Instagram are automatically posted to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bunminster/) and [Tumblr](https://bunminster.tumblr.com), though we don't monitor those accounts very much. 

## Rabbit Resources

We plan to build this section over the year but for now, [here's our rabbit essentials](). 

## Support our friends

We're big fans of [Fat Fluffs](http://www.fatfluffs.com/), a rabbit rescue and sanctuary near Birmingham from where we adopted Clem in 2016. If you've enjoyed following our stories, please consider [making a donation](http://www.fatfluffs.com/donate/).
