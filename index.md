### [Bunminster, Joy and Clem](http://bunminster.uk/the_buns/) are rabbits living in a garden in Birmingham, UK.

This website is run by their owners/servants Fiona and Pete who have been caring for rabbits since 2013. It will eventually contain everything they've learned about rabbits, shared for the benefit of others. We hope you find it useful!

## Bunstagram

We're very active in the bunny corner of [Instagram](http://instagram.com/bunminster/) where we're friends with lots of other rabbit owners. Beyond the cute, it's a great community of mutual help and support whenever something goes wrong.

Pics from Instagram are automatically posted to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bunminster/) and [Tumblr](https://bunminster.tumblr.com), though we don't monitor those accounts very much. 

## Rabbit resources

We plan to build this section up over the year. So far we have: 

[Rabbit Essentials](http://bunminster.uk/essentials/) - a very basic guide to keeping rabbits.

[Rabbit's Guide to Birmingham](http://bunminster.uk/birmingham/) - the vets and suppliers we recommend in our home town. 

## Support our friends
