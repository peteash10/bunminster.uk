# This is what we feed our rabbits. 

You can get everything you need from a decent pet shop, but bear in mind that a rabbit's diet is pretty much the same as a horse, so try and find somewhere that sells hay and grass for horses. *You will save a lot of money!*

## Hay

They should always have an endless supply. This must never run out. It stimulates their digestive system properly and grinds their teeth as they eat. A rabbit with a bale of hay and a supply of water is a happy rabbit. 

We use IKEA's [Variera plastic bag dispensers](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/kitchen-products/kitchen-organisers-shelves/variera-plastic-bag-dispenser-white-art-80010222/) as hay hoppers, in front of a litter tray so they can poop as they eat. In the summer this is outside under a shelter. In the winter it's in the shed. For three rabbits we get through two loosely packed hoppers a day. 

Small packs of hay can be expensive so try and buy bales. We were getting half-bales for £17 from the pet shop until we discovered [Hungry Horse](http://hungryhorse.org), a horse feed shop which sells full bales for £5.50. A full bale lasts us about a month. 

## Water

Along with hay, this is an essential that must never run out. We used to use bottles but Bunminster in particular doesn't like them, so we switched to a [refilling water tower](http://amzn.to/2FUBRrB) refilled once a day and it's great. 

A big issue with outdoor rabbits is keeping their water unfrozen in the winter. This water tower doesn't fit in the heated section of their hutch so we put a small bowl of water in there during frosty nights. 

## Grass

Grass is the purest of rabbit food. Unfortunately you need a whole meadow to satisfy one rabbit, which is why we buy dry hay, but any grass is better than no grass. 

Our lawnmower is a sad, lonely thing, covered in cobwebs. The rabbits mow the lawn these days. Sometimes they eat it too hard and we have to pen off an area to recover, but we like to let them graze for at least half an hour. In the summer we move the office into the garden and they're out on it all day!

A good trick is to cut long grass from the local park to bring home, though make sure you rinse all the dog wee off first! 

## Readigrass

This is cut grass that has been carefully dehydrated leaving the nutrients intact. It's a great substitute when your buns have mown the lawn down to the last blade and it's not grass-growing season. If you buy [the packs with a rabbit on the front](http://amzn.to/2ph4qW1) it's £5 for a kilogram, which is crazy expensive, but if you buy it with a horse on the front it's £15 for 15kg (at least it is from our supplier - [Hungry Horse](http://hungryhorse.org)). That's a fifth of the price and makes it much less of a luxury food! We give our dudes a couple of handfulls three times a day during the winter, less if they have access to fresh grass. If you can get hold of cardboard egg trays they make perfect holders!

## Pellets

Pellets are a supplement, ensuring your buns get the vitamins and minerals they need. Many people give their rabbits a good portion of pellets a day, say a palm-full. Our vet says rabbits don't need them as long as they're getting everything else on this page. We like to use them as bribes to get the dudes to come in from the garden and rewards for being handled. A shake of the pellet box works wonders now! 

*Do not confuse this with the cereal mixes (see below) which are evil.*

We like [Selective](http://amzn.to/2FZaIUA) which is often on offer at the pet store. Just make sure you keep it on a high shelf as they *will* get into it! 

## Vegetables

![](/images/greens.jpg)

Once a day we give the dudes a bowl of fresh greens. Usually this is kale which is fairly cheap from the supermarket, mixed in with any suitable scraps from our own dinner. Carrot peelings, brocolli stems, etc. They can eat most of anything a human can eat, but you should be careful not to give them some things in excess. Mostly this is greens that are high in oxalic acid. Kale is low which is why we default to it. Cabbage can be high so only a leaf or two of that. 

The House Rabbit Society page on [Suggested Vegetables and Fruits](https://rabbit.org/suggested-vegetables-and-fruits-for-a-rabbit-diet/) is a good, reasonable guide.

## Fruit

According to [rabbit.org](https://rabbit.org/suggested-vegetables-and-fruits-for-a-rabbit-diet/) there should be 10% of fruit in their fresh (ie, non-hay) diet. We don't do this religiously but we do use fruit as a treat, usually when we're eating a banana or apple ourselves. They go crazy for this and will smell fruit from the other end of the garden as soon as it's opened. Great for having otherwise shy rabbits climb over you! Banana chips are a good alternative to fresh fruit as they keep for ages but make sure they don't have sugar added. 

## Cereal / Museli mix

![](/images/bad-food.jpg)

This is often sold in pet shops as "rabbit food" but it should be avoided at all costs. If it's their main food source it will make them fat, lazy and unhealthy. If it's a supplement it won't add anything useful. Just say no.

## Random plants

![](/images/gardenplants.jpg)

Rabbits will eat pretty much anything, even if they shouldn't. We have a rabbit-safe section of the garden which is mostly lawn, and Fiona's section of the garden which has beds and plants she likes to keep alive. The rabbits are alowed in the latter in the winter under supervision to help with pruning but are chased off the bad plants. 

We've ensured the garden is mostly free of the Big Bads. These include Anemones, Arrow Grass, Bluebells, Broken Fern, Burdock, Buttercups, Clover, Daffodils, Dahlia, Deadly Nightshade, Delphiniums, Fireweed, Foxglove, Hemlock, Horehound, Honeysuckle, Iris, Ivy, Jimson Weed, Lilies, Laurel, Lupine, Milkweed, Poison Hemlock, Poppies, Primrose, Snowdrops, Sweet Clover, Tarweed, Tulips and Water Hemlock. But it's easier to just keep the buns away from them. 

Obviously Deadly Nightshade etc are quite serious, but most of the bulb-related plants are not, in our experience, immediately poisonous. Bunminster would not be with us if this were the case as he nibbled on a patch of bluebells for a year before we realised he shouldn't! We find that given the choice they'll test the bad stuff but default to healthy. The main thing is not to present poisonous plants exclusively as food. 

## Anything else?

They are many ways to feed a rabbit and while this works for us you may find a variation works better for you. Plus some rabbits have special dietary needs. The best person to ask for advice is you vet or, if you adopted, the rescue centre.
