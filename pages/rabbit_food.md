# This is what we feed our rabbits. 

You can get everything you need from a decent pet shop, but bear in mind that a rabbit's diet is pretty much the same as a horse, so try and find somewhere that sells hay and grass for horses. You will save *a lot of money!*

## Hay

An endless supply. This must never run out. We use IKEA's [Variera plastic bag dispensers](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/kitchen-products/kitchen-organisers-shelves/variera-plastic-bag-dispenser-white-art-80010222/) as hay hoppers, in front of a litter tray so they can poop as they eat. In the summer this is outside under a shelter. In the winter it's in the shed. For three rabbits we get through two loosely packed hoppers a day. 

Small packs of hay can be expensive so try and buy bales. We were getting half-bales for £17 from the pet shop until we discovered [Hungry Horse](http://hungryhorse.org), a horse feed shop which sells full bales for £5.50. A full bale lasts us about a month. 

## Grass

Grass is the purest of rabbit food. Unfortunately you need a whole meadow to satisfy one rabbit, which is why we buy dry hay, but any grass is better than no grass. 

Our lawnmower is a sad, lonely thing, covered in cobwebs. The rabbits mow the lawn these days. Sometimes they eat it too hard and we have to pen off an area to recover, but we like to let them graze for at least half an hour a day. 

A good trick is to cut long grass from the local park to bring home, though make sure you rinse all the dog wee off first! 

## Readigrass

This is cut grass that has been dehydrated leaving the nutrients intact. It's a great substitute when your buns have mown the lawn down to the last blade and it's not grass-growing season. If you buy [the packs with a rabbit on the front](http://amzn.to/2ph4qW1) it's £5 for a kilogram, but if you buy it with a horse on the front it's £15 for 15kg (at least it is from our supplier - [Hungry Horse](http://hungryhorse.org)). That's a fifth of the price and makes it much less of a luxury food! We give our dudes a couple of handfulls three times a day during the winter, less if they have access to fresh grass. If you can get hold of cardboard egg trays they make perfect holders!

## Greens

Once a day we give the dudes a bowl of fresh greens. Usually this is kale which is fairly cheap from the supermarket, mixed in with any suitable scraps from our own dinner. Carrot peelings, brocolli stems, etc. They can eat most of anything a human can eat, but you should be careful not to give them some things in excess. Mostly this is greens that are high in oxalic acid. Kale is low in oxalic acid which is why we default to it. 

The House Rabbit Society page on [Suggested Vegetables and Fruits](https://rabbit.org/suggested-vegetables-and-fruits-for-a-rabbit-diet/) is a good, reasonable guide.

## Fruit

According to [rabbit.org](https://rabbit.org/suggested-vegetables-and-fruits-for-a-rabbit-diet/) there should be 10% of fruit in their fresh (ie, non-hay) diet. We don't do this religiously but we do use fruit as a treat, usually when we're eating a banana or apple ourselves. They go crazy for this and will smell a banana from the other end of the garden as soon as it's opened. Great for having otherwise shy rabbits climb over you!
