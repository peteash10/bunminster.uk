At some point we'll get around to documenting everything we know about rabbits for the benefit of others in our situation, but for now here are the very basics:

*   Adopt, don't shop - there are thousands of abandoned rabbits at sanctuaries around the world. Please visit one before buying a farmed baby from a pet shop. Locally (Birmingham, UK) we recommend [Fat Fluffs](http://www.fatfluffs.com) and [Withall Rescue](http://wythallanimalsanctuary.org.uk/animal/rabbit/).
*   Hay, not cereal - Rabbits do not need all that fancy nonsense you can buy for them. Sure, they'll eat it all up but then they'll get fat and ill, and you don't want that. Fresh, normal hay, every day. Plus a few greens in the evening (kale is great). A small amount of pellets (something like [Selective](http://amzn.to/2rUo7GL) is great) keep the diet balanced which we mostly use as bribes and rewards. That's it!
*   A hutch is not enough - Dudes gotta run! Ours live outdoors in a big 6ft hutch with 24 hour access to a 12x6ft aviary which they can run around in. We also give them at least half an hour outside on the lawn to get their motors really firing. Indoor rabbits should have full access to at least one room. There is nothing more awesome than watching your rabbit run free!
*   Save your pennies - rabbits are expensive pets, particularly at the vets. We currently budget about Â£500 a year medical expenses for three dudes, which is totally worth it of course.

If you ever have questions about rabbits and don't know who to ask, please feel free to ask, either via Instagram or directly ([Pete](http://peteashton.com) / [Fi](http://fionacullinan.com/contact/))
